Our concepts of locations and maps have drastically changed over time with discovery of new knowledge and technologies. But such innovations have also turned maps into a powerful tool for both autocracies and democracies, oppressors and oppressed, big businesses and small research institutes.

As members of an increasingly digitized world, we experience firsthand the impact of location technology. Now we are all trackable; smartphones, cars, even TV's can gather data about our daily lives. The digitization of locations have allowed us to navigate a massive, hectic world so much more conveniently, but at what cost? Our privacy? Our freedom?

This blog is a collection of thoughts about all things space-related. Not outer space -- our space, human space. This blog was made for the Data and Human Space class at NYU Abu Dhabi, but the ideas presented are just as relevant to the outside world.

Enjoy!
