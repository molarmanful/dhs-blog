        <p>Humans are treasure troves of data. From tiny, specific bodily functions like heart rate and muscle reaction time to large, general behaviors like daily routines and crowd movements, virtually anything human can be quantified and visualized. And with the help of modern technology, collecting human data has never been easier. The first US census was recorded entirely on paper and had five questions about each family – all of which related to gender, race, or age. Unsurprisingly, <a href="http://www.1930census.com/1790_census.php">about one-third of that data has been lost or destroyed.</a>. But nowadays, the American Community Survey and similar censuses are able to be conducted mostly online. This poses several benefits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Less respondent burden due to the relative ease/speed of filling out and submitting an online form.</li>
  <li>Less collector burden due to the security and flexibility of storing large amounts of data online.</li>
  <li>Simple distribution and repurposing of data due to the ease of creating online databases.</li>
</ul>

<p>Improvements in data collection technology have not only improved census taking, but also made such technology conveniently accessible to the people. Website developers can use SEO tools and page hits to gauge visitor traffic and tweak marketing strategies. Youtube content creators can see details about their viewers – general region, amount of time watched, like/dislike, comments – to personalize content and cater to a wider audience.</p>

<p>Most importantly, however, <em>we</em> – the people – are now able to collect data about <em>ourselves</em>. Consider, for example, the iPhone. iPhones come with various apps that assist us with day-to-day tasks: timing, calling/texting, browsing Reddit – you name it, the App Store has it. Many of these apps require sensors provided by the phone: Snapchat needs access to camera and microphone, Google Maps needs access to location, fitness apps connect to smart watches and activity trackers like Apple Watch or Fitbit to collect data about heart rate, steps walked, and other health indicators. Even the Clock app is able to measure and visualize your sleep cycle.</p>

<p>Given all this data, then, what would a map of the self look like? Well, it would be phenomenally complicated, to say the least. A map like this would probably be viewed in frames, perhaps one frame per second. In each frame, a map large enough to fit every location you have traveled – from birth to death – would serve as the background. Superimposed on that map background would be an erratic line representing the path of your movement over time. A silhouette of you would be situated somewhere along that path. Your height, weight, heart rate, emotion, state of mind, actions being performed, etc. at that time would be labeled. By advancing the frames, you would be able to see yourself moving, growing, changing every second.</p>

<p>This kind of map would be quite difficult to implement, but it would be a worthwhile endeavor.</p>
