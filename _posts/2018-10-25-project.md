[Torn Apart/Separados](http://xpmethod.plaintext.in/torn-apart/volume/2/index) is a project that aims to reveal the deep web of corporate connections that the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has built. From data collected between 2014 to 2018 about corporation-ICE contracts, a team of scholars and activists have created a variety of vivid visualizations depicting various aspects of ICE's convoluted infrastructure.

The first visualization you are presented with when viewing the project is a map of the US, with each district colored depending on the amount of funding awarded by ICE. Hovering your cursor over a district will reveal more information about that district's funding situation; for example, my home district -- California's 14th District -- has received $140,000 from ICE, with an image-processing company called MotionDSP receiving $100,000 of that funding. Other visualizations include a rain chart showing the significant increase in money and amount of ICE contracts given out from 2014 to 2018, a bar chart showing the amount of money given by ICE to minority-owned businesses, and a web showing the complex interactions between companies involved with ICE.

All of these visualizations do reveal the absurdity of ICE's whole operation. The amount of money spent on corporate contracts along with the tangled mess of interactions between the involved companies just goes to show the impracticality and waste of time that immigrant deportation has brought. Perhaps equally concerning are the types of companies involved: universities, media companies, tech companies, and websites. Many of the contracted entities are brands and names that many of us would label as respectable or morally righteous (ex.: Dell, Amazon, LinkedIn, Johns Hopkins) -- and yet those same companies are complicit in the displacement of hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants every year.
